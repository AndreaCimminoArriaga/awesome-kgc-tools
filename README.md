# Awesome KGC Tools

Links and description of Knowledge Graphs Construction Tools


## KGC Materializers
* [Chimera](https://github.com/cefriel/chimera) - Framework based on Apache Camel to define composable semantic data transformation pipelines (lifting/lowering to/from RDF)
* [RMLMapper](https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java/) - The RMLMapper executes RML rules to generate high quality Linked Data from multiple originally (semi-)structured data sources 
* [RMLStreamer](https://github.com/RMLio/RMLStreamer/) - The RMLStreamer executes RML rules to generate high quality Linked Data from multiple originally (semi-)structured data sources in a streaming way. 

## KGC Virtualizers

## KGC Pre-processors

## Mapping specifications
* [RML](https://rml.io/specs/rml/) - The RDF Mapping language (RML) is a mapping language defined to express customized mapping rules from heterogeneous data structures and serializations to the RDF data model. 
* [Target in RML](https://rml.io/specs/rml-target/) - Alignment between RML and Target to describe how your knowledge graph should be exported to one or multiple targets.
* [DataIO](https://rml.io/specs/dataio/) - Target, a formal model and a common representation for specifying how a Knowledge Graph should be exported to a given target
* [FnO](https://fno.io/spec/) - Function Ontology (FnO), a way to semantically declare and describe implementation-independent functions, and their relations to related concepts such as parameters, outputs, related problems, algorithms, mappings to concrete implementations, and executions.
* [YARRRML](https://rml.io/yarrrml/spec/) - YARRRML is a human readable text-based representation for declarative generation rules.

## Mapping Editors
* [Mapeathor](https://morph.oeg.fi.upm.es/tool/mapeathor) - Definition of Excel-based mappings and translation to [R2]RML mappings
* [Matey](https://rml.io/yarrrrml/matey/) - Matey is a web based editor for YARRRML rules.
* [RMLEditor](https://github.com/RMLio/rmleditor-ce) - RMLEditor offers a Graphical User Interface to enable data publishers, who are domain experts, to model knowledge derived from heterogeneous distributed data.
